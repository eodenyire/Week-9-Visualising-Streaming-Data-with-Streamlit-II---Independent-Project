# Project Brief: Visualising Streaming Data with Streamlit II

# Introduction:

In this project, the goal is to create a real-time data visualization dashboard using Streamlit to analyze streaming data from Reddit. The objective is to identify fraud in telecommunications by monitoring Reddit for mentions of telecom fraud and related keywords. The project involves connecting to Reddit's API, collecting real-time posts, processing the data, and visualizing it using Streamlit.

# Problem Statement:

Telecom fraud is a significant issue that costs the industry billions of dollars each year. Detecting and preventing fraud in real-time is crucial to minimizing financial damage. The task is to develop a data visualization dashboard that monitors Reddit for telecom fraud mentions, extracts relevant information from the posts, and analyzes the data for patterns and trends related to fraud.

# Project Requirements:

Connect to Reddit's API and collect real-time posts related to telecom fraud and related keywords.
Process the posts to extract useful information such as post text, user name, subreddit, and date/time.
Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends associated with telecom fraud and related keywords.
Use Streamlit to create an interactive data visualization dashboard that displays real-time information about telecom fraud.
Include at least one chart or graph in the dashboard that presents the data effectively, such as a bar chart showing fraud mentions by subreddit or a line chart showing the frequency of fraud mentions over time.
Design the dashboard to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with clear labels and instructions.

# Project Steps:

Set up a Reddit Developer Account and create an app to access the Reddit API.
Install the required Python packages, including praw, pandas, and Streamlit.
Write a Python script to connect to the Reddit API and collect real-time posts using the Reddit Streaming API. Authenticate API access using praw.
Process the collected posts to extract relevant information and store it in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Analyze the data using Pandas and NumPy for statistical analysis and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization.
Use Streamlit to create an interactive data visualization dashboard that presents real-time information about telecom fraud. Include at least one chart or graph to visualize the data effectively.
Test the dashboard locally to ensure it updates in real-time as new posts are collected.
Deploy the dashboard to a cloud-based platform like Heroku or AWS to make it publicly accessible.
